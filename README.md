# ThesisMA


In light of open science principles and to promote transparency and reproducibility, I have made the code used for my master thesis in Marketing Management at Tilburg University publicly available. The code can be accessed on GitHub and includes the scripts and analyses conducted in the study.

Furthermore, as part of my commitment to data privacy and protection, the data has not been added to this respository. The full anaonymized dataset is available upon request.
